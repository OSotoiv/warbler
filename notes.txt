Why does the user model have a location attribute and why is it a text field?

Why does Users model have a followers and following attribute relationship to USER?? shouldnt it be to followers

Home route gets messages but doesnt seem to specify which users messages to get....

messages are protected on the home page. but if you know the username you can still search and see their page!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is this ok?

{{Step One: Understand the Model
Read models.py. Make a diagram of the four tables.
Note that the follows table has an unusual arrangement: it has two foreign keys to the same table. Why?
******So that you can not follow some one twice
Using pdb, set a debugger in one of your routes, and hit it to pause code execution. From here, 
try out the various relationships set on the model classes. Get a feel for how they work.}}


YOU CAN FOLLOW YOURSELF.....is this ok?
I CAN UPDATE MY BIO IN pdb.set_trace() BUT IT DOESNT SHOW ON MY USER PAGE
SEARCH WORKS BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT THE EXACT CAPITALIZATION OF USERNAME. 
*MAYBE ADD A FUZZY SEARCH AND A SEARCH BY MESSAGES
CAN NOT ACCESS LIKES FORM MESSAGES MODELS.
*CHECK IF YOU CAN SEE A USERS FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWING IF YOU ARE NOT ALSO FOLLOWING. 
*DO YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT A FOLLOW. CAN YOU BLOCK/REMOVE A FOLLOW. 

*******LIKES AND FOLLOWS WAS NOT IN THE ROUTE SO I ADDED THEM. 

NEXT:
try to add likes and move through the followers. 
also how am I able to follow if follows was not imported into the app.py file????????

****TO ADD LIKES FEATURE I WILL UPDATE ROUTES TO APPEND THE MESSAGE TO g.user.likes.append(message)
this will create a like. so you dont need the Likes class in the app.py routes because you can access 
like through the user model.

time about 3hrs working on warbler. 1/8/23 1:44am

notes about is_following method on User model. >>> if user is following other user. other user is place in a list
we then check the length of the list. 

>>>come back to check on the class you added to this users header background image. see if style.css
already has a class for this image.
<img class="image-wraper" src="{{user.header_image_url}}" alt="Hearder image for {{user.username}}">
I took off the class because it didnt seem to make a difference.  also the background header img is flowing into the details.
is this ok?
last header_images original links are not working
>>>correction made to original code base......user/show.html line 9 a tag had / at the end of
